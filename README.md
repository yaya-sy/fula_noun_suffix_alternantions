# fula_noun_suffix_alternations
Fula  is  a  language  which  exhibits  phonetic  form  alternations  of  noun  suffixes,  and  it  is  not  easy  to predict the suffix form.  The goal is to learn a probabilistic model to rank phonological features-based constraints  and to predict the suffix form of a given noun using these constraints. The estimated parameters must be interpretable.
